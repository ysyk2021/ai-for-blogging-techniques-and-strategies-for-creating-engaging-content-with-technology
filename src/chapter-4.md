Understanding Writing Clarity and Tone
--------------------------------------

Writing clarity refers to how easily readers can understand written content. This involves using clear language, proper grammar, and correct spelling. A clear and concise writing style can help engage readers and convey information effectively.

Tone, on the other hand, refers to the writer's attitude or perspective towards the topic they are writing about. An appropriate tone can help establish credibility and connect with readers on a deeper level.
